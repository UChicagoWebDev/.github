# Web Development
### UChicago MPCS 52553 - Winter 2026

The syllabus and other course materials are here on GitHub: https://github.com/UChicagoWebDev/course_materials/blob/main/syllabus.md.

Course administration is on Canvas at https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/67482.

In-class and take-home assignments will be shared in this GitHub Organization as private repositories. To complete an assignment, create a fork of the repo. Check out your repository, and push your changes as you work on it. When you are done, submit the URL of your repository on Canvas. The timestamp on the repo, not the Canvas submission, is the one we use for determining if a submission is late, so you are not penalized for forgetting the Canvas upload. But they take much longer to find and grade if you  don't explicitly submit a link, so posting the URL is required. For future assignments we'll use the same repo. In each case, push your changes to GitHub and submit your URL on Canvas.

Join the class on Slack on [the UChicago CS Slack](https://cs-uchicago.slack.com). Sign up with yourcnetid@**cs**.uchicago.edu. If you're enrolled in the course, you have an @cs email alias already created automatically. Add yourself to the #web-development channel, which is public.

Lecture notes and in-class examples are on GitHub at https://github.com/UChicagoWebDev/course_materials.
