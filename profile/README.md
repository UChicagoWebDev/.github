# Web Development
### UChicago MPCS 52553 - Spring 2024

The syllabus and other course materials on on [Canvas](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/57047).

To sumbit an assignment, follow the GitHub Classroom link on Canvas, which will create a private fork of the assignment repo. Check out your repository, and push your changes as you work on it. When you are done, submit the URL of your repository on Canvas. The timestamp on the repo, not the Canvas submission, is the one we use for determining if a submission is late, so you are not penalized for forgetting the Canvas upload. But they take much longer to find and grade if you  don't explicitly submit a link, so posting the URL is required.


Join the class on Slack in the #web-development channel on [the UChicago CS Slack](
